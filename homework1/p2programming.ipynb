    "> **Hint:** Note that for `linear_regression_train.txt`, there are 2024 rows with 12 columns where the first 11 columns are features $ x $ and the last column is target $ y $. The `linear_regression_test.txt` only contains 10 rows with 11 columns (features). Both of these tasks require the submission of code and results. Put all the code in a “HW1_yourID_Q1.ipynb” Jupyter notebook file. (A “.py” file is also acceptable.)\n"
